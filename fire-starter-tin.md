# Fire Starter Tin

This small form fire starter kit is great for camping, backpacking, or in your emergency gear. 
This kit contains enough supplies to light a camp fire several times over. 

The biggest limitation is the amount of fuel you bring, but this kit still works without fuel. It just won't be as easy!

## Supplies

- Bic Mini lighter
- Dryer lint
- Pocket Bellows
- Oil-based handcream (recipe below)
- Small sealable container (e.g. lip balm tube)

## Packing instructions

1. Place the lighter and handcream in the tin in opposite corners.
1. Line the open space with several layers of dryer lint.
1. Place the pocket bellows on top.
1. Cover with more dryer lint as desired.

## Starting a Fire

It is so easy to start a fire with this little kit. Just four simple steps:

1. Rub some hand cream into a bit of dryer lint to make great starter fuel.
1. Place the oily lint ball in your fire pit and surround with small/dry brush and twigs. 
1. Light the lint ball with your lighter.
1. Blow gently to stoke the flame.

There is some technique to stoking a flame with the pocket bellows. 
Try not to blow on the fire itself, and instead aim for the embers. 
Even a nearly dead fire can be revived with some encouragement.

Holding the wide end of the bellows to your mouth, blow air evenly and slowly at first.
Once the flame builds and more things start to catch fire, increase the air flow and watch the flame roar to life!

## Oil-based Handcream Recipe

While other handcreams may work fine, I choose to make my own. 
If you decide to use an off the shelf cream, be sure to test that it will light easily and burn cleanly. 

Use the following ingredients and scale to your needs:

- Beeswax: 1 gram 
- Mineral oil: 5 ml

### Preparation

I prefer to use a double boil method when mixing the beeswax and oil. A Pyrex bowl works well for this.

1. Add all ingredients to the bowl and double boil over a pot of water until the wax melts. 
1. Stir occasionally to help it along.
1. Once the wax is fully melted, pour the mixture into shallow jars to cool.

Also, keep in mind that the wax will be tough to clean off and shouldn't be done over your kitchen sink. The wax will solidify when it cools and could gunk up your pipes.
